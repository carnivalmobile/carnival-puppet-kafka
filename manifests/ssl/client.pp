# Creates an SSL client keystore which can be used by applications wanting to
# authenticate to this Kafka cluster.
#
# Note: As we are generating the client certs on the Kafka nodes themselves,
# we will end up with certs being created on each server. This isn't a big
# issue, since we validate by the CA, not by the individual cert fingerprint,
# but if it bothers you, you'd need to mount ${ssl_dir} as shared storage
# amongst the cluster members.
#
# Note: To make SSL authentication actually work, make sure you add the
# following param to Hiera:
#
#   kafka::broker::config:
#     ssl.client.auth: required
